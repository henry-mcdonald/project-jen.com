    Weclome to project JEN. 

    <p>
    This is project JSON Everything Now
</p>
<p>
    What this means is as of yet unclear. 
</p>
<p>
   The gist is that we like to put the logic that drives 'web', 'internet', and 'computer' etc. etc. into .json files
</p>

<p>
    As to why we want to do this, again it is unclear. We will gain clarity on our mission over time. 
</p>

<p>
    In broad terms we think that in the codebase that powers the world, there is quite a lot of duplication of logic. 
    Things like standardization of commands across OS, or across PAAS services, etc. It would be nice if this logic
    could be ported into a more agnostic intermediate layer. 

</p>
    
<p>
    We think that migrating logic to an intermediate language would more easily enable integration across software,
    across OS, etc. JSON as something that is not in fact a computer language, is the perfect candidate. It has 
    no built-in compilation mechanism which will help us retain incredible flexibility and avoid
    hard-coding of logic.  
    
</p>

<p>
    Concept of universal computer language... we like to make this a reality. A lot to figure out down the line. Let's
    see how far we get
